<div class="text"><p>I Am Arbaz Qureshi, Dual DEGREE B.tech and M.tech student, Now i am in 8th Sem. I have learnt web development, Nocode Tools like weweb,webflow etc and now I am looking work 
    that can give me confident towards my learning.<br>
I belong to Jhunjhunu district but currently I am in jaipur because of my graduction degree, I build this wesite as a portfoilo where I will show you how i created some games with help for my course and with Javascript.<br>
There are a lots of things for mention but some of highlights i would like to mention regrading this website and me.<br>
</p>
<p> This website is designed with the Help of HTML,CSS, AND JAVASCRIPT and the good thing is that i learnt some of JAVASCRIPT features while creating this projects because i learnt javascript but never used for any kind of animation<br/>
second thing I would like to mention that I have learnt vue.js a Javascript framework for some advance feature it's a mixture of react and angular, at that time i was not aware about react also should be part of my learning journey so <br>
I never moved towards React but now as I know React is also important so i started learning and hope soon build project with help of React and vue so i could improve in me and can surve better for my job.
</p>
<p> I learnt Digital marketing because it's a one of booming industry as tech and there is SEO, SEO stand for search engine optimization that help so much for ranking in google. As a web developer i am aware about how important is ranking a website<br>
Digital marketing that gives me idea of how a website's speeds matter, structure matter, links matter and there are other componets that are helpful in my tech journey
